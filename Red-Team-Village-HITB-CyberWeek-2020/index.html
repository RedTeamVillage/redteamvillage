</br> <p><b>Abstract: </b>Celebrating 15 Years of Security Weekly means we should go through the evolution of offensive security/ethical hacking. Where did this all start, where are we now, and where are we going? This talk covers everything from the early days of vulnerability scanning, vulnerability assessment, and vulnerability management (probably the hardest part of infosec today!). We then evolved to penetration testing to gain access and further test defenses. </br> We realized that attackers don’t just go after technology, so we began testing people and process as well as testing assumptions. Eventually we realized we had to work closer with the blue team (defenders) and built a purple team function to collaborate and more efficiently improve. Understanding and collaborating with the defenders led us to leverage cyber threat intelligence to provide the best business value by performing adversary emulations. This talk will cover all of these, best practices, tips, tricks, and of course, a use case where we can demonstrate it’s value so you too can convince management to perform similar assessments.

	</div>
			<p><b>Abstract: </b>We all agree that most organizations have some or the other service leveraged over cloud environments. To add to it, there are assets that are not linked directly to the public and not easily spotted. When it comes to Red Team Engagements it boils down to a simple statement. "Are you able to find something that wasn't supposed to be visible in the first place ?". Storage services by the cloud providers are usually not visible directly to the end user and are often overlooked by pentesters and Red Teamers. In this talk we will be leveraging the possibility of Storage Services of different cloud vendors and how if not properly configured could lead to a lot of Damage to the organization.
</br>
Storage services are almost always the second service started by cloud vendors after IaaS, it is done in that order for a reason. Cloud Storage irrespective of how simple it looks, is a complex deeply integrated component for cloud services. The primary purpose of storage services is to hold data of all kinds, besides its primary function it also performs multiple other actions. Storage allows building higher abstraction services on top of the it such as:
</br>
Static file hosting,FaaS or PaaS code hosting and Log storage
</br>

Due to its versatility storage is an area which should be looked at with a fine tooth comb. However the situation is far worse than what we can imagine. From exposing buckets to public, to leaking api keys or ssh keys in public. Things go from bad to worse when buckets also are leaking write access to source code leading to full account takeover scenarios.

This talk will cover the following aspects around Cloud Storage Services.
</p>
<ul>
<li>1. Basics of Cloud Storage Services and why to target them </li>


<li>2. Attack Methodology to be followed </li>


<li>3. Various attack scenarios from real and bug bounty world</li>


<li>4. What are cloud vendors doing to protect this </li>


<li>5. What the developers or admins have to keep in mind </li>


<li>6. Question and Answer </li>
<p>Note: Demo videos will be interspersed throughout the slides.</p>
</ul>

								<li><a href="#" class="icon alt fa-linkedin" target="_blank"><span class="label">LinkedIn</span></a></li>
							</ul>
	</div>
	<p><b>Abstract: </b>Local privilege escalation techniques are far beyond checking the Windows/Kernel version, looking for unquoted service paths or checking SUID binaries.

Moreover, a local privilege escalation could make a huge difference when trying to comprise a domain.
Several tools have been created to find possible privilege escalation paths, but most of the tools for Red Team and Pentesting just check for a few possible paths, so pentesters need to use several tools and do some manual recon to check for everything.
</br>
During this talk I will present a suite of open source privesc enumerators that I have created called PEASS (Privilege Escalation Awesome Scripts Suite). The goal of this suite is to check and highlight every possible privesc path so professionals don’t need to execute several different tools and can very easily find the vulnerabilities.
At the moment, this suite contains the most complete and user friendly privesc enumerators for Windows (in .Net and bat) and Unix (Linux, MacOS, OpenBSD, FreeBSD).
Moreover, I will also show the privilege escalation parts of my book (https://book.hacktricks.xyz/) so people interested the topic can learn more more after the talk.
</br>
Notice that independently of the technical level of the audience I’m sure that they will learn some new privilege escalation vector.</p>

		<p><b>Abstract:</b> The accelerated transition to cloud services and the rising adoption of cloud hybrid architecture is being leveraged by threat actors, who are both targeting cloud environments and weaponizing them as an attacking surface. On-premise misconfigurations and vulnerabilities have been replaced with new risks and attack paths which abuse cloud and cross-platform connectivity. In this session, the Sygnia team will discuss a few of the major trends in cloud environment attacks and present a new open-source tool, designed to support rapid visualization and the identification of potential attack paths in cloud environments.</p>

				<p><b>Abstract:</b>  The world is moving towards smart culture everything nowadays is smart, and mostly all are those smart devices are basically embedded devices with internet connectivity or some provision to connect with the internet. Since these devices are booming in the market this also tempting lots of people/groups for hacking.
</br>In this 1 hour talk we will discuss how to test the embedded/IoT devices, it would give you a methodology for assessment, how to extract firmware from storage chipset with help of Hardware Testing, how to perform firmware analysis, identifying vulnerable components, basic approach for reverse-engineering the binaries to discover potential remote code execution, memory corruption vulnerabilities by looking for native vulnerable functions in C or bad implementation of functions like System, popen, pclose etc.
</br>After conducting static analysis, firmware analysis we will move towards a dynamic testing approach which includes web application testing, Underlying OS security testing, identifying vulnerabilities and misconfiguration in the device. At last, we will move towards fuzzing the device via web application parameters and installing an appropriate debugger on the device to identify memory corruption vulnerabilities.

		<p><b>Abstract:</b> How to perform payload delivery and compromise a company that have a very small attack surface during an Offensive Security exercise?
Let's talk about this through a real-life feedback!
The goal is to provide both blue and red perspective sharing some TTPs and tips from payload creation, mitigations each redteamer have to deal with and how defender can detect it.
Jean-marie will presents a customized (and how to do that) payload delivery from 0 to pwn using the well known .hta (T1218).</p>
	<p><b>About the speaker:</b> Jean-Marie (kmkz) is an experimented Penetration tester and Red/Purple teamer that works now as a team leader in POST Luxembourg.
His favorite part is post-exploitation, physical security and initial accessing in the most realistic condition that he consider as the most useful approach in term of security challenging human, processes, technologies etc..
He was speaker in "Nuit du Hack, Paris in 2011" , and more recently he presented talks in "Security Bsides, Dublin 2019", "Swiss CyberSecurity Day 2020", RootCon14 and other smaller event such as "JS meetup, Luxembourg 2019".</p>

		<p><b>Abstract:</b>Obtaining access and sensitive information of critical and high awareness areas through the combination of classic formats of Social Engineering attacks. 
Controls and filters advance according to market demands and it is becoming increasingly difficult to perform generic phishing simulations with a considerable scope, without these being rejected by security systems, reaching the spam mailbox or alerting security filters and preventing the integrated display of malicious mail.
</br> How to bypass an antivirus in a service under a black box format? How to bypass firewalls so that systems can be accessed without being stopped? Is it necessary to go unnoticed?
As a unit we have specialized in the last five years in the development of pretexting, persuasion techniques and extremely particular and effective simulation scenarios.
</br> This paper presents 3 cases of mergers of classic Social Engineering formats united under concepts that we call Physical Spear Phishing and Vishing Web Scam. The physical-digital tools and techniques used for the realization of objectives will be explained.
One of the first difficulties we have in SE services is the short time we have in relation to an organized criminal band. They manage to carry out effective attacks after periods of six to twelve months of research and testing. We only have 5 to 10 days for the entire project: Information gathering, execution and reporting.
So, trying to replicate the real-time flow of an attack's entirety is unworkable and trying to emulate it in such a narrow time only yields results that are not close to reality, thus generating false security in the collaborators involved in the simulation.
</br>
For this we were obliged to look for processes and techniques that would place us in a realistic scenario of high reach.

</br></br>
<b>Case I: Physical Spear Phishing</b></br>
Physical intrusion + nominative mail + QR code link + website + corporate credential capture</br>
Security Conference + Workshops. </br>
Target: Infection and credential capture of a specialized security unit.</br>
Location: Client Office.</br>
Client: Reserved.</br>
Pretext: A couple of couriers show up at the front desk of an office to deliver "Full Access" tickets to the largest cybersecurity conference in Chile. Nominative invitations for a group of collaborators associated with the specialty. These also gave them the right to participate in workshops ideally close to their interest and concerns stated in their Linkedin profiles. Obviously, the quotas are for a limited time or until the number of enrollees is exhausted.</br>
Circumstances given: The objectives were a group of just over ten people who as a common denominator were their advanced knowledge of cybersecurity and that none of them attended the awareness talks offered to the whole company and which only they did not attend by their decision.

</br></br>

<b>Case II: Physical Spear Phishing</b></br>
Physical Intrusion + Specialized Magazine Recognition + Invitation to Award Event + Pendrive with Extended Malicious File Interview. 
Validation of the Ego
</br>
Target: Access CEO offices and infect the CEO equipment.</br>
Location:  CEO offices.</br>
Client: Reserved.</br>
Pretext: Representative of a financial magazine carries a recognition for the CEO and with it a pendrive with an extended interview.
</br>
Circumstances given: Simulation included in a set of simulations for a RedTeam. This area was not excluded for intrusion, but nor was it approved as they simply insisted that we would not be able to enter due to the four existing controls of which two were armed guards and with appointment validation and identification needed.
</br></br>
<b>Case III: Vishing Web Scam</b></br>
Phone call + central table + website + capture of corporate credentials + download and install an executable.
Vishing Web Scam Black Box in the context of a Red Team.
</br>
Target: Technical Support obtaining basic computer data, corporate credentials, downloading and installing malicious application.
</br>
Location: Phone contact, website, app.
</br>
Client: Reserved.
</br>
Pretext: Support impersonation for remote work support, verification of the connection threshold, downloading and installing an executable.
</br>
Circumstances given: During the lock down period and with all employees working in remote mode, the support pretext is used to carry out an attack on the assistant CEO of a company since it was removed from the targets.</br></p>
