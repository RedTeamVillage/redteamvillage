								<h3>About The Diana Initiative</h3>
								<header>
									
									<p>A conference focused on Women, Diversity, and Inclusion in Information Security that embraces all genders, sexualities, and skill levels. The Diana Initiative features multiple speaker tracks, fully expanded villages with hands-on workshops, and a women-led Capture the Flag event.<br>

This year, our slogan “Breaking Boundaries Byte by Byte” allows us to focus on the different ways that representation in cybersecurity – whether gender, sexuality, skill level, or red/blue/purple team alignment – can help protect data today and into the future. </p>

She identifies herself as a South Asian woman of Indian Origin having lived in the US and the UK and worked for small to large corporations.  In 2017, she took a sabbatical at the peak of her career, to pursue her passion for helping women, as adults, youth, and children, overcome structural barriers to personal growth. She decided to go back to school to study Social Sciences and towards the end of her academic work at Harvard University, she founded "Women in Crisis Response", a to-be non-governmental social organisation with its core foundation based on United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325 (UNSCR1325) on Women, Peace, and Security, and UN's Human Development Report 1995 definition of "Human Security".
		Through her organisation, she wants to bring about a systemic change in how individuals and communities think and act about security.  Her work focuses on strengthening all aspects of Human Security i.e. including gender, and digital inequities that influence cyber-physical security</p>
		<p><b>Abstract:</b> This talk is specifically focused on increasing awareness about the interconnected of the internet not only in our day to day to lives but also into our critical civil infrastructure such as water treatment facilities, energy grids, hospitals, etc., she brings attention to the fact that just like essential workers are recognized as critical to continue BAU for our personal lives during the Covid-19 pandemic, these civic infrastructures are also essential services and that we must not wait for a serious incident like the pandemic to make us realize that but rather pay crucial attention to their safety and security and to the coupling impact they have on us proactively and work in strengthening their resilience. The talk highlights attention to the gender gap in cyber security and in this area and how women can help close this gap and gives an opportunity to discuss challenges and how to close them.<br>

		<p><b>About the speaker:</b> Jas is working with T-Mobile as a Senior cyber security engineer. Before that, she worked in the DC Government and Bank of America for many years. She is leading the blue team in her organization. For her, cyber security has never been more important, securing the important personal information that our customers provide and living up to their trust and expectations that we’ll keep their information safe is an important part of her role, and provides the purpose and conviction to do her job every day.<br>
		For Jas, Cyber security brings a new challenge every day, she calls it, “a fascinating game of cat and mouse where bad actors are always trying to break into your systems.”  As an ethical hacker, her job is to try and protect our systems by thinking like one of the bad guys and trying to find ways to hack into systems, ultimately making them more secure. She believes you  never run out of exciting scenarios to play with (hack) in cyber security. There is always something new to learn and to explore.</p>
		<p><b>Abstract:</b> Jas will talk about how moving security left in the SDLC  benefits the organization, reduced risk and improved security. How security works TOGETHER, Not against, Developers.<br>

		<p><b>Abstract:</b> PNowadays, the GraphQL technology is used by some of the big tech giants like Facebook, GitHub, Pinterest, Twitter, HackerOne. The main reason behind that is that GraphQL gives enormous power to clients.
		But, with great power come great responsibilities. Since developers are in charge of implementing access control and other security measures, applications are prone to classical web application vulnerabilities like Broken Access Controls, Insecure Direct Object References, Cross Site Scripting (XSS) and Classic Injection Bugs. This talk will be explaining the common security impacts faced while using the Graphql APIs and how an attacker makes use of it to attack the underlying infrastructure and ex-filtrate sensitive data from an organisation.<br>
