	<p><b>Abstract:</b> If you are the kind of person who enjoys workshops with practical information that youcan immediately apply when you go back to work, this workshop is for you, all action, nofluff :) Attendants will be provided with training portal access to practice some attack vectors,including multiple mobile app attack surface attacks, deeplinks and mobile app dataexfiltration with XSS. This includes: Lifetime access to a training VM, vulnerable apps topractice, guided exercise PDFs and video recording explaining how to solve theexercises.This workshop is a comprehensive review of interesting security flaws that we havediscovered over the years in many Android and iOS mobile apps:
An entirely practical walkthrough that covers anonymized juicy findings from reports that we could not make public, interesting vulnerabilities in open source apps with strong security requirementssuch as password vaults and privacy browsers, security issues in government-mandatedapps with considerable media coverage such as Smart Sheriff, apps that report humanright abuse where a security flaw could get somebody killed in the real world, and more.
The workshop offers a thorough review of interesting security anti-patterns and how theycould be abused, this is very valuable information for those intending to defend or findvulnerabilities in mobile apps.This workshop is for those who are intending to broaden their knowledge of mobilesecurity with actionable information derived from real-world penetration testing of mobileapps.Please come caffeinated, the audience will be challenged to spot vulnerabilities at anymoment :) <br><br>

	<p><b>Abstract:</b> Lock picking and physical security bypass<br><br>
		<b>About the speaker:</b> For more than 30 years, Kevin McPeake has been a author, keynote speaker, innovator, pioneer and leader in cybersecurity and technological risk management domains. And the connection of cybersecurity to shareholder value is truly encoded into both his DNA and his career history. In 1991, Kevin invented the first product and co-founded one of the first two-way radio tower monitoring companies, Location Data Systems, Inc., which was wholly acquired by Motorola in 1995. In 1998, he co-founded Trust Factory, the first full-services cybersecurity consulting firm The Hague, which is now considered the cybersecurity capital of the Netherlands. He was the first public figure (2000) to call for making cybersecurity a function of Finance, rather than Technology, as a means to improve governance, organizational agility, and remove many of the business blockers, conflicts of interests, and high overheads that often affects security teams when cybersecurity operates as a function of Technology or Operations departments. He went on to implement this structure in two GSM companies - Orange (2004) and T-Mobile Netherlands (2015). He is the founder and driver behind Peak Security, a cybersecurity boutique focused on providing a sustainable ecosystem of security solutions, products and services, located in the center of The Hague, Netherlands.

	<p><b>About Speaker: </b>Adam Laurie is a security consultant working in the field of electronic communications, who specializes in reverse engineering of secure embedded systems. He started in the computer industry in the late Seventies, working as a computer programmer on PDP-8 and other minicomputers, and then on various Unix, Dos and CP/M based microcomputers as they emerged in the Eighties. He quickly became interested in the underlying network and data protocols, and moved his attention to those areas and away from programming, starting a data conversion company that rapidly grew to become Europe's largest specialist in that field (A.L. Downloading Services). During this period, he successfully disproved the industry lie that music CDs could not be read by computers, and wrote the world's first CD ripper, 'CDGRAB'. At this point, he became interested in the newly emerging concept of 'The Internet', and was involved in various early open source projects, the most well-known of which is probably 'Apache-SSL', which went on to become the de-facto standard secure web server. <br> Since the late Nineties he has focused his attention on security and has been the author of various papers exposing flaws in Internet services and/or software, as well as pioneering the concept of re-using military data centers housed in underground nuclear bunkers as secure hosting facilities.
Adam aka "Major Malfunction" has been a senior member of staff at DEFCON since 1997 and is the POC for the London DEFCON chapter DC4420. Over the years has given presentations on forensics, magnetic stripe, EMV, InfraRed, RF, RFID, Terrestrial and Satellite TV hacking, and, of course, Magic Moonbeams. He is the author and maintainer of the open-source python RFID exploration library 'RFIDIOt'.

	<p><b>Abstract:</b> How many times have you heard “it’s not a vulnerability (or bug), it’s a feature” after finding some functionality that you are sure can be used maliciously? It happens quite frequently. There is an entire project called Living of the Land Binaries and Scripts (LOLBAS) that features Microsoft signed binaries and scripts that allow attackers to leverage the built-in features for their own good. This happens a lot and it is why we want to talk about how the offensive security industry has evolved and matured from CVEs to TTPs. While finding bugs and vulnerabilities pays, how can one benefit from when it is “a feature”? By creating, sharing, and selling TTPs, we can all benefit from the work that was already done but vendors don’t want to pay for. <br><br>
		<b> About the speaker:  </b>
		Jorge Orchilles is the Chief Technology Officer of SCYTHE and co-creator of the C2 Matrix project. He is a SANS Certified Instructor and the author of Security 564: Red Team Exercises and Adversary Emulation. He was a founding member of MITRE Engenuity Center of Threat-Informed Defense.

	<p><b>Abstract:</b> Work from home is on the rise (thanks COVID), and with it, proponents of the zero-trust model are also gaining in popularity. But what does this entail for red team operations? What will hacking enterprises look like in the upcoming few years?

We'll review together major trends surrounding cyber security in the zero-trust era - and not marketing concepts, buzz words or academic theory. This talk will look at the future of network security, how our favourite vendors are aligning their tool stack for 0-trust security, but also the up and rising start-ups that have already raised millions of $ to help enterprises implement zero trust.  </br> </br>

	<p><b>Abstract:</b> The process of penetration testing starts with the “Reconnaissance Phase”. This phase, if performed carefully, always provides a winning situation. However, often in the application security and bug bounty hunting, recon is mapped to finding some assets and uncovering hidden endpoints only & is somewhat under-utilized. Recon is the most crucial thing in application security and bug bounties which always keeps you separated from a competing crowd and gives easy wins. In “Offensive Recon”, will cover the deepest and most interesting recon methodologies from mapping new assets to automating the security vulnerabilities, signature-based findings to be one step ahead of your competition, and how to utilize the tools and publicly available information to map your attack surface & maximize the profit. Most of the time due to lack of streamlined Recon process given the scope, people end up wasting time looking for the resources which may not be in scope or are not fruitful provided the engagement. Given that, Scope Based Recon is another methodology that enables one to identify what to look for in a specific scope provided. He will be launching a Scope Based Recon tool Project Bheem which is a collection of handy scripts & existing tools under a single window to perform Scope Based Recon.

	<p><b>Abstract:</b> Social engineering exercise such as Phishing campaigns are commonly used to test employees' awareness in a company/organization. This exercise involves mostly the combination of phishing emails and websites. An effective campaign requires sophisticated methods starting from designing a phishing website to executing payload at the target in an undetectable manner. One of the timeconsuming process is that when multiple campaigns involving both email and website are what all data to be tracked and the difficulty to centrally track and consolidate. Other than tracking common information such as link clicks, user IP, etc., the phishing website contains different fields for each page, and capturing those data always requires manual coding. In addition, hosting, encrypting, and managing payloads used for phishing exercise requires some manual effort.
SniperPhish is an advanced Web-Email spear-phishing toolkit developed to conduct professional phishing assessments. The abstract idea behind this toolkit is to conduct, combine, and centrally track all campaigns that involve email and phishing websites. SniperPhish can easily be integrated with the phishing website containing multiple pages and track users together with email campaigns. The advanced customization in the report generation tool helps to export the results in multiple output formats with no or minimal customization later. In addition to the core campaign module, SniperPhish also supports hosting payloads, encrypt them, and converting them to FUD using methods such as reflective DLL/PE.

	<p><b>Abstract:</b> Red team is a commonly misunderstood offensive security discipline. Red team has been used as a general term for all areas of offensive security just as blue team for defensive security. True red teaming goes Beyond Pentesting and into more adversarial emulation. While there are overlapping skills, there are differences that will be discussed as Phillip shares his experience of going from a pentester to a red teamer. In this talk, you will learn about the different areas that make up red team operations, common tools, and the path to becoming a red teamer. In this presentation, you will learn about resources helpful for a path into red teaming. <br><br>

	<p><b>Abstract:</b> Local privilege escalation techniques are far beyond checking the Windows/Kernel version, looking for unquoted service paths or checking SUID binaries. Moreover, a local privilege escalation could make a huge difference when trying to comprise a domain. Several tools have been created to find possible privilege escalation paths, but most of the tools for Red Team and Pentesting just check for a few possible paths, so pentesters need to use several tools and do some manual recon to check for everything. During this talk Carlos will present a suite of open source privesc enumerators that he have created called PEASS (Privilege Escalation Awesome Scripts Suite). The goal of this suite is to check and highlight every possible privesc path so professionals don’t need to execute several different tools and can very easily find the vulnerabilities. At the moment, this suite contains the most complete and user friendly privesc enumerators for Windows (in .Net and bat) and Unix (Linux, MacOS, OpenBSD, FreeBSD). Notice that independently of the technical level of the audience they will learn some new privilege escalation vector.
Carlos will be publishing his notes and Awesome PrivEsc scripts after th talk.
