								<h3>About ROOTCON 14 Recovery Mode</h3>
								<header>
									
									<p>ROOTCON was founded back in 2008, the word ROOTCON is derivatives from the two words root (a unix super-user) and con as conference.

The inception of ROOTCON was inspired due to the lack of legit security / hacking conference in the Philippines, how the conference is run is fully inspired from the worlds largest hacking conference in the world which is DEF CON, like DEF CON, ROOTCON controls and minimize product pitching from its sponsors which gives a hell of a boredom to its attendees. To maintain it's high-caliber talks, ROOTCON screens its speakers and topics through the Call For Papers.

Like any other conference, ROOTCON also hosts mind-boggling hacker games such as Capture The Flag, Semprix' Mysterybox and of course the infamous Hacker Jeopardy.

ROOTCON has maintained it's posture as the neutral grounds for the hacking community, both underground and the enterprise, we have been successful in keeping access to the conference affordable for the hacking community. This balance between content and affordability is the reason ROOTCON has been consistently a huge success.  </p>

		<h3><b>Workshop 1: Adversarial Simulation Lab using Splunk Attack Range</b></h3>
		<h4><b>Rod Soto</b>,<i> Principal Security Research Engineer at Splunk</i></h4>
		</div>
	<p><b>Abstract:</b> The Splunk Attack range framework provides different tools to allow security analysts to test network, host and applications against a number of known adversarial TTPs based on Mitre ATT&CK framework. The Splunk Attack Range framework allows the security analyst to quickly and repeatedly replicate and generate data as close to "ground truth" as possible, in a format that allows the creation of detections, investigations, knowledge objects, and playbooks in Splunk Phantom.
This 2 hour workshop will provide attendants with access to Splunk Attack Ranges containing adversarial simulations engines (Caldera, Atomic Red Team), target machines and a Splunk server receiving attack data. Instructors will provide step by step instructions on where to get the code for the framework, how to build it and how to use it to simulate attacks, create detections and defense artefacts.

	<p><b>Abstract:</b> If you are the kind of person who enjoys webinars with practical information that you can immediately apply when you go back to work, this webinar is for you, all action, no fluff :)“Hacking Modern Desktop apps: Master the Future of Attack Vectors” is a desktop app security course that provides you with case studies from real-world vulnerable applications as well as know-how and techniques to take your desktop app security auditing kung-fu to the next level. The course covers attacks and mitigation against desktop apps on Linux, Windows and Mac OS X. The focus focuses on Electron but the techniques covered will be helpful against other desktop platforms, as well as CSP bypasses and other web security techniques. In this brief 60-minute webinar we will explain what the course covers and give you a few lab samples covering the following topics:<br>
●Essential techniques to audit Electron applications<br>
●What XSS means in a desktop application<br>
●How to turn XSS into RCE in Modern apps<br>
●Attacking preload scripts<br>
●RCE via IPC<br>
Attendants will be provided with training portal access to practice the attack vectors covered. This includes: Lifetime access to a training portal, vulnerable apps to practice, guided exercise PDFs and video recording explaining how to solve the exercises

	<p><b>Abstract:</b> It’s not new for Red teams and offensive hackers to buy 0day exploits from Darkweb. In last two year there has been a lot of Incidents where Red Teams/ offensive Security researchers need to regularly keep their third vision in these darkweb portals where they sell 0day exploits and other vulnerabilities ensuring the anonymity. Zoom to Tor, Exploits were easily accessible. Threat intelligence has opened up a scope of a new extended area of Vulnerability Intelligence that need to be gathered from Darkweb and other deep web platforms. The network of anonymous groups are extended from Darkweb to the Telegram/Jabber and to their marketing side on twitter handles which helps them to gain attention from Cyber Security journalists.</p>

	<p><b>Abstract:</b> DeimosC2 is a Golang built command and control application that supports multiple communication methods such as QUIC, TCP, HTTPS, DOH, and pivot TCP. We have agents that are run on Windows, Linux, Darwin, and Android with iOS to come. For security purposes each listener has its own public and private RSA key that wraps AES encryption with the agent to make forensics more difficult. Each agent also supports functionality such as jitter, delay, EOL, and live hours to make it harder to detect. We also support webshells for the times that you have an arbitrary file upload on a website that allows you to manage your webshell. You can than take that webshell access and deploy a C2 agent to further your control over the victims device.

 <br>

DeimosC2 also supports modules for multiple operating systems that have both agent and server sections. This allows us to collect looted data. DeimosC2 has a GUI that is built with Vue.js that makes it easier to use and supports collaboration between multiple red teamers. It supports MFA, password length restrictions, and two user roles (admin and user). The C2 server also supports archiving of the database and all log files for historical purposes which can also be replayed if the C2 infrastructure needs to be stood back up, to include the compiled agents that were used during the engagement.

 <br>

One of the key features of DeimosC2 is that agents and modules can be developed in any language as long as the responding format to the C2 server is in the correct format which we made as JSON to simply everything. This makes it easily extendable. It is also easy to add custom agent functions like we did after a DefCon talk released the concept of Domain Hiding which we instantly added for our HTTPS agent. DeimosC2s future is moving towards mobile as a way to highlight the lack of security around enterprise mobile devices.</p>

	<p><b>Abstract:</b> Recent problems in mitigating cyber attacks are the threats evolving into a highly sophisticated landscape. It is challenging to address “Known unknowns and unknown unknowns”. As data sets increase in size and complexity, the human effort required to inspect dashboards or maintain rules for spotting infrastructure problems and cyber attacks. Enriching your internal telemetry and automated threat intel lookups even at pre ingestion phase of the data provides more value to the data set in efficient hunting and automates the production of highly valuable operational intelligence.<br>

This Paper talks about the automation of enriching data alerts and telemetries both at pre ingestion and post ingestion methods to addressing sophisticated threat landscapes.</p>

It comes with a CLI application and Web Interface written with StreamLit. DockerENT is designed keeping in mind that during deployments there weak configurations that are sticky in production deployments and lead to severe consequences. This application connects with running containers in the system and fetches the list of malicious runtime configurations and generates a report. If invoked through CLI it can create JSON and HTML report. If invoked through web interface, it can display the scan and audit report in the UI itself. More at https://github.com/r0hi7/DockerENT</p>
